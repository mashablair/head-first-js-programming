# Head First JavaScript Programming

This repo contains exercises and projects I've done while studying the book "Head First JavaScript Programming" by Eric Freeman
and Elisabeth Robson.

## Table of Content:

Chapter 1:  Intro, var, while loops, etc.
Chapter 2: Logic, battleship game, built-in functions
Chapter 3: Functions, bank robbery
Chapter 4: Arrays, phras-o-matic
Chapter 5: Objects
Chapter 6: DOM
Chapter 7: Serious Types, all weird things in JS
Chapter 8: Building the App. The Battleship Game.

## Note:
For simple JS exercises I use .html files with <script> for my inlined JS code, so that I can see the result in a webpage right away.  For more complex code (like Battleship game), I use external .js files.
