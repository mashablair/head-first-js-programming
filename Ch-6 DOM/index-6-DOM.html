// Let's create a full-proof way to execute this code by making sure it runs AFTER the page has fully loaded:
function init() {
    var planet = document.getElementById('greenplanet');
    planet.innerHTML = 'We have been hit!'; // 'innerHTML' is not a method!  It's a property!
}

// and here is the magic:
window.onload = init;
// we assigned our function to window.onload property. We are NOT calling the function!
// window object is built in to JS. It = browser window.
